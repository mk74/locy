Progress:

I have done:
    -edited sample apps:
        -printing values every 5 secs
        -accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS
            -side note: 0 as rate for accelerometer and gyroscope

    -new APP 802.11Wifi
        -scans and prints all hot-spots

    -GPSSatellites sample app:
            (trying to separate triangulation from satellites readings)
            -to get GPS Event, you need to register location updates
            -location updates onChangedLocation method gets Location object on which latitude and longitude is already present
            -earlier experiment is valid
                -exp: I was not printing position -> use less energy, print  position -> use more energy
                    -thought: triangulation is done when printing(getting this vars)
                    -reality: I/O operations' cost only
        -conclusion: Android API doesn't allow to read GPS satellites without doing triangulation
        -probably possible on lower level, but don't want to get sidetracked

    -tested all new versions of sample apps on both devices

    -propose new way of making experiments
        -measure time which is needed to deplete battery life from 99% to 98%

    -run exps:
        Google Nexus 7:
            accelerometer                       after half an hour still    100%
                                                after an hour               98%
            wifi scan                           after half an hour          100%
                                                after an hour               98%     

        Google Nexus 7  (10 hours):
            -accelerometer                                                  64%
            -gyroscope                                                      64%
            -indoor wifi scan                                               63%
            -gps indoor                                                     57%

        HTC flyer:
            accelerometer                       after an hour               86%

        
    -context survey:
?       -WifiSLAM   
            -wifi-based indoor localization
?       how indoor localization will be done?
        -new idea: calibration based only on wifi scan list, instead of network-based location
            -how accurate is measuring distance to access point basing on signal strength

    -other Android stuff
        -pipe LogCat to file
            -http://simonguest.com/2013/07/03/persistent-logging-in-android/
            -after restart: logcat -v time -r 4096 -n 100  -f  /mnt/sdcard/logs/logcat.txt &
                -clear: logcat -c && rm /mnt/sdcard/logs/logcat*
            -would be useful to have root access to put it as service


Meeting:
    -digression: indoor wifi localization, how this will be done?
            -special setting up(current state of knowledge)
            -technology(hardware) or software
            -internet of things?
            -will we achieve it?
    -talk through results
    -discuss proposed way of doing experiments:
        -how stable this way is?
        -repeat experiment n times:
            -show distribution, p-value, standard derivation
            -hypothesis: measurements should not vary
