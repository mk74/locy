        Network-based localization is quite high but:
            -new location is coming every 20 secs
            -probably wifi scan is done rarely
                suitable for outdoor localization, but not indoor
        HTC flyer:
            from time to time, takes a while to deplete from 100 to 99, but then depletes next 5 percenrtages very fast
            
        did cleaning in app's directory

        started writing SensorsGraphPlotter app(draws graph functions of sensors data in real-time)
            used http://androidplot.com/
