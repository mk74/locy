Progress MONDAY:
	-continue making experiments
		-HTC flyer:
			in the middle of experiments, the results started dropping - faster battery depletion 
	
	-realized that i could more efficiently detect battery depletion(asynchronously)
		but still need to have TimerThread to print results every sec

	-new idea, experiments - offloading it to cloud, Google Nexus 7:
		-connected accelerometer:	661
		-connected WiFiScan:		601	

	-trying to solve bug in camera app on external saving on HTC desire
		turned out not enough dynamic memory on HTC desire, but I decreased the preview size and it's fine
?!		those preview sizes may be different across mobile phones, but camera is still significantly energy consuming so we don't need exact information

	-keeping consistency for Bluetooth app

	-HTC flyer, bluetooth
		-quite significant variation on results
