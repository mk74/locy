Progress:
	
	-cleaned and updated new experiments results
	-data analysis from previous experiments
		I see some pattern
		decided to increase amount of experiments to 5 samples
	-started writing skeleton for my energy-effciency part of my report
		-new hypothesis:
!			Android requires different energy measurement than Power model software as fragmentation problem

	-microphone data
		Google Nexus 7:
			-Codec: AMR narrow band(samr)
			-channels: 		mono
			-sample rate:	8000 Hz
			-bits per sample 	32
		HTC desire, HTC flyer:
			-Codec: AMR narrow band(samr)
			-channels:		1
			-sample rate:	8000 Hz
			-bits per sample:	16
			-Bitrate:		128 kb/s

	-camera data
		Google Nexus 7, HTC desire, HTC flyer:
			-Codec H263
			-Resolution	176&144
			-Frame rate		~10(HTC flyer),	~12(HTC desire),	~15(Google Nexus 7)

	-new thought - security concern
		-they don't ask for permission about accelerometer/magnetic field etc.
		-enable user tracking

	-written SensorGraphPlotter - helper app printing live accelerometer data:
		-sliding window 5000 gives 2.5 minutes
		-prints total acceleration magnitude
		-small bug: frozen sometimes with so many points 
			but i ignore it - no time
