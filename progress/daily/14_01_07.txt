    problems:
        Google Nexus 7:
            bluetooth LE is counter-intiutive
                it prints out a lot of inside information to log
?           there is "WiFI optimization" option? I do exps with this on

        htc flyer:
            -problem with charging to 100%
            -those random results
        htc desire:

        EnergyMeasurementPlain
            I have written plain sample measurement(does not do anything, just wait for battery depletion) app for comparison

        difficulties with measurement
            thinking about Monsoon PowerMonitor
