I have done:
	-I found http://howto.cnet.com/8301-11310_39-57596807-285/stop-android-4.3-from-always-scanning-for-wi-fi-networks/
		After switching this option off:
			Accelerometer: 	722
			WiFi Scan: 	601
		
	-new device from Tristan:
		-HTC desire
		-Android 2.3.3

	-edited measurement apps
		-accelerometer
		-gyroscope
		-WiFiScan
		-light
		-magnetic field
		-proximity
		-Network/GPS location providers
		-microphone

	-check how long WiFi scan takes on HTC:
		-results are not clear, more investigation needed
		-it happened that scan was completed within 1 sec, but there were no results on this WiFi scan.
		-it happened that program was not triggered for half a minute
			no wifi scan completed, no previous scan results printed(by TimerTask)
		-it happened that program behaved as expected but took 3 secs
		-after some time, behaviour stables around 13/15 secs
		-there is also bug in program!
		-to do:
			-check whether it is not active probing ?
			-check whether timer action is always triggered in the same way
		-don't investigate it further, stayed focused on main thing

	-changed slightly app and WiFI Scan on Google Nexus 7 takes 0.5 sec(!)
		-don't investigate it further, stayed focused on main thing


!	-worth looking inside Android code:
		-WiFi Scan
		-location service:
			-gps based
			-network based (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9507557/android-requestlocationupdates-updates-location-at-most-every-45-seconds)

Next:
	-camera app
	-run experiments
	-figure out which paper is about WiFi database thing
	-write naive baseline app
		how to scan and be connected at the same time?
	-write simple/light fingerprint database/backend
	-clear repo
	-fun: sniff probes
	-write day report at the end
