Progress:
	-meeting with Tristan
	-improved inLocy
		-uses simpler version of activity recognition(movement detection) algorithm presented in EmotionSense
	-I wrote simple helper app which allows user to label accelerometer data(moving/inPlace) by clicking button
		-those data may be imported to octave later and analyzed
