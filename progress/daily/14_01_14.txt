Progress:
	-polished Bluetooth LE app
		consistency output
		noticed that if there are no devices available, it prints out much less things to LogCat
		^^ showed this in experiments

	-experiments for HTC desire
		-finished: 3 samples for each sensor
		-in many places the results were invalid(somehow doubled?), so repeat for them
			-though questionable and requires further consultancy with Tristan 
		-light/proximity results
			-still problem with light, it seems to be much more energy efficient than over physical sensors
				-the result of staying in one place and not changing its value
			-to some extend, the same problem with proximity
				is proximity based on light in this phone?
			-other thing to check
				-different % will work better
		

	-experiments for HTC flyer
		-finished: 3 samples for each sensor
		-some invalid results which needs to be redo
