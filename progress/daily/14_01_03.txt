Progress:
	-Bluetooth:
		-info
			-the same frequency
			-works on shorter distance so use less energy
			-scan takes 12 secs + querying each devices which was found
				-for one device in the network -> around 12 secs
		-have written the sample app

	-Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE)
		-don't know really the difference between Classic and BLE
			-only software layer ?
		-Android:
			-new in version 18
			-still shaky: no callback when scanning finished, not sure whether synchronous or asynchronous
		-written app

	-Near Field Communication (NFC)
		-looked it up fast
		-control by Android
		-can't switch it on/off programmatically(you can through WRITE_SETTINGS, but that's not a point)
		-left it over

	-Camera
		-started looking at the code which I have written before the Christmas
