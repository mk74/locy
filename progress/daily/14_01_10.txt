Progress:
	-Trying to find proper %:
		-desire:
			tried:
				-98->97
					-Accelerometer	403
				-95->94	
					-Accelerometer	451
				-but realize that sometimes charging does not begin if battery is more than 91%
			-89->88 works nice
		-flyer 
			-98->97 works nice

	-running experiments:
		desire 89->88
		flyer 98->97

	-to talk with Tristan about:
		-utility issue in my previous research idea
			no assistance, but location information still may be used in other ways
		-accuracy if we provide that we have WiFi fingerprints and mapping function
			-how to compare it with accuracy accelerometer gives?
