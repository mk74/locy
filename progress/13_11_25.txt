I have done:
    -Idea: "Measuring the time in which battery is being depleted by 1%"

    -written the module which checks elapsed time between two battery levels
        plugged this module into accelerometer, WiFI802.11 Scan and Gyroscope

    -run the accelerometer app on the range 95% -> 94%
        -it takes 720 seconds 

    -run the apps on the range 99% -> %98:
        accelerometer:
            -1: 660 seconds
            -2: 660 seconds
            -3: 660 seconds

        WIfI802.11 Scan:
            -1: 780 seconds
            -2: 780 seconds

        Gyroscope:
            -1: 720 seconds
    
    -the energy hypothesis: 
        accelerometer > gyroscope > Wifi802.11 scan

    -beside:
        run 10 hours experiment of previous sample app:
            -WifiScan   62%
            -previous result was 63%
