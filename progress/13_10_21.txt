I have done:
  -clear directories + added prototypes to github
  -energy measurement:
	-rough idea how they work:
		-states of hardware ->energy consumption (e.g. PowerTutor) 
		-other do baseline computations and then delta difference (e.g. TrepnProfiler)
	-found software and evaluate it (betterBatteryStats, PowerTutor, Battery Stats Plus, Battery monitor widget and Trepn Profiler)
		-PowerTutor
			-power consumption as metrics
			-http://powertutor.org/
			-specified for Nexus 1
			-don't take into consideration accelerometer, camera
		-TrepProfiler:
			-power consumption as metrics
			-https://developer.qualcomm.com/mobile-development/performance-tools/trepn-profiler
			-low-level software running on specific chipset
				-provider of those chipset is producer of that software
				-though most of Android phones (no tablets) are from qualcomm
					https://developer.qualcomm.com/devices
				-works for Nexus 7
			-repetitive measurement return the same results
			-console access (I thought that it meant online measurement, but it is not possible when mobile phone is charging)
			-looks like Anroid's equivalent of Nokia Profiler Tool, which was widely used in research 
			-possible to log to file (csv) 
		-BetterBatteryStats
			-battery life as metrics
		-Battery Stats Plus
			-battery life as metrics
		-Battery monitor widget
			-power consumption as metrics
			-not easily possible to do automatic testing
	-my choice: Trepn Profiler
	-I played with Trepn Profiler from adb shell
	-started writing apps for measurement

Meeting:
	1. Energy measurement
		-test for an hour on power consumption metrics - 'short measurement'
		-test on battery life later till the battery is depleted - 'full measurement'
		-check whether order of sensors is the same?
		-to show on variety of devices
			-if not Snapdragon processor, make full measurment
		-measure the worst possible outcome
			-while loop
				-wifi-gps
				-left camera running
		-new sensros to table 1:
			magetometer, microphone
	2. Architecture/design:
		-keep documentation of each sensor when you are writing apps
			-what's good/what's bad
	3. Discussing my context-survey
