Progress:
	requirements copy/paste from DOER
	edited objectives to sound more as scientific projects
	write introduction
		where mobile sensing fits
		what exactly mobile sensing is
		energy consumption is a crucial issue
		there is energy-accuracy tradeoff
		this work
			investigate this issue
	split of context survey
	writing energy measurement sections
		easy for Nokia, as Nokia Profiler, no such solution for Android 
		hardware solution PowerMeter from Moonsoon
			problems: only under lab environment
		Software power profiler
			using power model and values given by the vendor
			examples: PowerTutor, Power Monitor Widget
			problems: just estimation
					battery characteristics change
					information on physical sensors is missing
		----------STOPPED HERE
