Progress:
	requirements copy/paste from DOER
	edited objectives to sound more as scientific projects
	write introduction
		where mobile sensing fits
		what exactly mobile sensing is
		energy consumption is a crucial issue
		there is energy-accuracy tradeoff
		this work
			investigate this issue
	split of context survey
	writing energy measurement sections
		easy for Nokia, as Nokia Profiler, no such solution for Android 
		hardware solution PowerMeter from Moonsoon
			problems: only under lab environment
		Software power profiler
			using power model and values given by the vendor
			examples: PowerTutor, Power Monitor Widget
			problems: just estimation
					battery characteristics change
					information on physical sensors is missing
		----------STOPPED HERE
		TrepnProfiler
		Measuring battery life:
			BetterBatteryStats, Battery Stats Plus

	+points for other chapters

	questions:
		like citeulike but for url?


Meeting/Feedback:
	Put web links as misc in citeulike and limit amount of them

	seperation of objectives and requirements
		objectives: I want to have this knowledge
		requirements: exectly how this is going to be achieved

	introduction for each chapter to make flow

	after energy measurement, write current results on "the order" between 

	define sensor in phone sensing, emphasize what you have learnt
