Meeting 7/10.:
I have done:
	-read how satellite navigation works/GPS/ mobile phone tracking(trilateration/multilateration/triangulation), accuracy, geofencing
	-read Android: what sensors/ what OS - changes, overview/ activity recognition/ fused location provider/ SensorFramework/ android's architecture
	-Read about EmotionSense and extracted part of library which we are interested: AdaptiveSensing.java and SociableSense's paper
	-Run Android:
		-set up environment(decided on Eclipse + ADT, not Android Studio)
		-code HelloWorld(+ java refresher)
		-code list all sensors with power(!) + print Accelerometer's values
		-clone app using ActivityRecognition + make it working on my tablet testing of that, when wifi on/off

What I should do:
	-context-survey: 
		-evolution of all frameworks which I am checking
		-what do they do? what don't they do? 
		-what's good? what's bad?
			-ActivityRecognition/ Fused Location provider/ Sensor Framework
			-research papers' solutions
	-design API/architecture basing on that context-survey
	-investigate energy usage of sensors(is it like what Google says in their API )
		-reproduce Table no 1 from Senseless paper
