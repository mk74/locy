Progress:
    reiterate over points
    write up software engineering processes
    write up design section
    start implementation section
    reiterate over error bars, but still don't know what they will say
        am i doing it correctly ? standard deviation?

    how to interpret failed samples:
        -done:
            -differences between devices:
            -differences between sensors for desire:
        -bursty errors in flyer:
            to do
                


    questions:
        use statistics about amount of commits
        how much i should bold?

        "To alleviate those differences, the least energy-efficient strategy of complete, correct sampling is chosen for the comparison of sensors' energy efficiency"
            reasons?

        -when i give examples of output in design, should i give for all of them ?
