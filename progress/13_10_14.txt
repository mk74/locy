Meeting 21/10:
I have done:
	-read and evaluate "How to read a paper", "SenseLess...", "Enloc" (halfway through), literature survey on energy-efficient mobile phones
	-research ActivityRecognition Framework

I was stuck:
	-energy measurement: what should I measure(battery life, energy consumption)? What to use for measuring it?
	-design decisions: from bottom I know what I should take, but API to applications much depends on how much intelligence we put inside

Meeting itself:
	-discuss papers(what they do, what's important for us)	
	-energy measurement issue, hint: betterBatteryStats
	-design issues (should continue working and realize that a lot of design will be created as a result of those things which I already know)
		-we are not going to use higher level user interactions patterns
		-we are not going to specify budget before
		-some way of specifying trade-off between accuracy and energy
			-just flag or 10 degrees?
				-start with flag
	-other issues to do:
		-upload prototypes to repository
		-better documentation of what we are doing
		-software for writing design(dia, graphivz, tikzpicture)
		-add two papers to CiteULike(JigSaw, entracked)
