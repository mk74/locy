I have done:
    WiFiScan experiments:
        -I compared against KisMac
                    -strength different and sometimes see a bit different amount of networks but usually the ones with smallest strength are missing)
        -I was checking whether WiFI scan results change

    HTC flyer experiments, battery depleted from 99% to 98%(Time interval 5 secs):
         accelerometer:  300 secs
         gyroscope:      300 secs
         wifi scan:      30 secs
                         215 secs        (both scans when mobile phone is in place)



    Google Nexus  7 experiments, battery depleted from 99% to 98%(Time interval 5 secs):

          wifi scan:      845 secs            when I am moving
          wifi scan:      785 secs            when the phone is in place
          accelerometer:  720 secs
          gyroscope:      720 secs

          wifi scan in place later:
                            725
                            725
                            785
                            665


    Other ideas:
        -measuring power by physical device http://www.msoon.com/LabEquipment/PowerMonitor/
            -very, very expensive, but probably difficult to plug normal power monitor

        -Google Nexus 7 experiments, battery depleted from 99% to 98%(decrease time interval to 1 sec):
            -results:
                Wifi Scan: 601
                           600
                           601

                    (WiFI results stay the same for three consecutive seconds)

                Accelerometer:  662
                                661
                                661

                Gyroscope:      661

            -Active and passive scanning 
                -there is active scan startScanActive() - undocumented, ** hide ** 
                    why?

            -Google Nexus 7, WiFI Time Scan from startScan to receive intent that results are available:
                ~2.30 secs

    Other fun:
        -I went through the lab and figerprint 4 places in terms of available networks and strength
            didn't make sense from geometric point of view

Questions:
    -in gelocation API on Android, I can specify minimum distance. How does it work?
    -some data framework for WiFI Scans

I have NOT done:
    -two links about Power measurement
    -Valentin Radu's paper
    -how much time WiFiScan takes on HTC flyer
