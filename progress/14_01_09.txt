I have done:
    -measurement apps:
        -added:
            -Bluetooth
                -scan takes 12 secs + quering each available device
            -Bluetooth Low Energy
                -scan duration is set by user
                -new in Android version 18
                -shaky(no callcback when finished, prints a lot of logs)
            -Camera
                -needs to have preview, but minimized
                -saving video to file
                -also a lot of log prints
            -Plain app
                -printing "Empty line"
        -polished others
            -consistent about the size of print logs
                -e.g. WiFI scan prints only number of available networks

    -looked at:
        -Near Field Communication(NFC)
            -controlled by Android/ not easily switched off/on <- can by WRITE_SETTINGS

    -experiments
        -settings:
            -found one option which I did not switch of for WiFIScan
                -it allowed to keep scanning and sending information to Google even if WiFi is Off
            -"forget" about all WiFi Networks
                -when WiFi was on, it was automatically connecting to known networks
        -problems:
            -htc flyer and desire:
                -takes forever to charge to 100%
            -htc flyer
                -many samples are failed ones:
                    -battery depletion from 100% to 99% takes very long time
                    -then depletion from 99% to 95% takes immiedietely

        -results:
            -htc flyer and desire:
(to discuss?)   only partial results
            -Google Nexus 7:
                -run three times each and averaged:
