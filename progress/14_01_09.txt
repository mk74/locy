I have done:
    -measurement apps:
        -added:
            -Bluetooth
                -scan takes 12 secs + quering each available device
            -Bluetooth Low Energy
                -scan duration is set by user
                -new in Android version 18
                -shaky(no callcback when finished, prints a lot of logs)
            -Camera
                -needs to have preview, but minimized
                -saving video to file
                -also a lot of log prints
            -Plain app
                -printing "Empty line"
        -polished others
            -consistent about the size of print logs
                -e.g. WiFI scan prints only number of available networks

    -looked at:
        -Near Field Communication(NFC)
            -controlled by Android/ not easily switched off/on <- can by WRITE_SETTINGS

    -experiments
        -settings:
            -found one option which I did not switch of for WiFIScan
                -it allowed to keep scanning and sending information to Google even if WiFi is Off
            -"forget" about all WiFi Networks
                -when WiFi was on, it was automatically connecting to known networks
        -problems:
            -htc flyer and desire:
                -takes forever to charge to 100%
            -htc flyer
                -many samples are failed ones:
                    -battery depletion from 100% to 99% takes very long time
                    -then depletion from 99% to 95% takes immiedietely

        -results:
            -htc flyer and desire:
(to discuss?)   only partial results
            -Google Nexus 7:
                -run three times each and averaged:
                    Accelerometer:              721                                 (781     721     661)

                    Network-based localization  842



What I am up to:
    -SensorsGraphPlotter


Meeting:
    -feedback:
        -measurement apps:
            -bluetooth 4.0
                -poor api so it is not so energy-effcient
                    -it's not fair if programs don't have ability to explore low-energy hardware as software is not written in good way
            -camera
                -check whether iPhone does the same
                -api forces you to do things less energy efficient
                
            -nfc:    
                -play with it a bit more
            -WIFI:   
                -POWER SAVE MODE, comprise tradeoff
            -microphone:
                -parameters()
                    -how many bytes?
            -polishing app's output - consistency:
                -show examples of output in my report
                
!!      -research ideas:
            -first idea
                -for single user it does not make sense, as there is no utility
                    (my later edit:there is utility, not direct to human though. The mobile phone knows where you are without the need of the user to type it)
                -only makes sense if you crowdsource it and then download
            -other idea
    -to do:
        -finish experiments on other devices and compare
        -start writing report
            -introduction
            -context survey
            -energy measurement
        -simple app and reiterate over it
