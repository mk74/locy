	-did experiments each 15 minutes WITHOUT PRINTING INFO:
		-network-based							849 mW
		-network-based, wifi on						926 mW
		-gps indoor							1,194,10 mW
		-gps outdoor							1053,50 mW				but Wifi was on(!)						
		-gps outdoor moving around					764,68 mW

		-mistakes made/ questions arises:
			-forgot to switch off Wifi during GPS outdoor in-place experiment
			-didn't print any values on screen
				-do I actually get any data?
				-does it require additional CPU power
					e.g. for GPS?	
	-did small experiments on wifi on when i am doing wifi on:
		conclusion: requires Wifi on to calculate things
	-hypothesis so far:
		gps indoor> gps outdoor(?) / network-based(wifi on) /gps outdoor moving around / 
			
	-did experiments when printing values:
		-network-based
			-trepn_start, wifi on, EnergyMeasurement, leave for 15 minutes
				-digression: when i go to NetMeasure it gives me result immediately (without EnergyMeasurement it doesn't)
			-result: 925 mW			(run for ~16 mins, but it is average anyway)
		-gps outdoor:
			-trepn_start, wifi on, EnergyMeasurement, leave for 15 minutes
			-result: 1720 mW
		-gps outdoor moving:
			-result: 1583,13 mW
		-gps indoor will be the same since searching and no single locatino is given
			-result: 1194,10
	-hypothesis so far:
		gps outdoor > gps outdoor moving > gps indoor > network-based

	-did small experiments on accelerometer:
		-trepn_start, AccMeasure, leave for 15 minutes
				1577.34	mW	 but it updated screen every 0.8 secs()
		the same, without printing values
				911 mW	 again it updated every 0.8 secs
		problem with specifying rate, since it updates much faster than it was said!
				796 mW when specified rate equals 1000000 seconds(!), but again without printing values
		need to invesigate this further(!)
		What to do? how to compare those values?


-other small concerns about my experiments:
	-all google's play service SDK is on as I chose so at the beginning, I think that I should switch it off
	-screen is on all the time(but durign the baseline as well)

-generally experiments should be repeated 
	-switch off Google Play Service SDK
	-run for an hour


todo:
	investigate accelerometer's issues
	write script for running experiments
	finish experiments
