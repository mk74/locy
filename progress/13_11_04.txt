I have done:
	-research new Android Kitkat 4.4 / Nexus 5
		-Kitkat:
			-soon available for Nexus 7 - "coming weeks"
			-source code available on Android Open Source Project
			-focused on consistent experience across the entire yser base
				"One OS to Rule them ALL"
				-fighting fragmentation
				-so reducing OS resources
					-but mainly memory ("All about memory optimization")
		-Nexus 5
				-novel way of using  LTE -> signal amplifier changes -> energy saving

	-research Mozilla Location Service
		-so far: publicly available data, but still need to query them over the internet
		-planning: put data on mobile phone
			-wokring on how to obscure them
				-in Google Location Service, you need to include 2-3 access which are next to this access point, so it "proves" that the requeste is near the access points
				-^^ mozilla wants to do the same and keep data on mobile phone -> crypto
					-unlike Google Location Service, they don't store MAC or SSID, but SHA1(MAC+SSID) only - they claim that at least.

	-experiments:
		-env:
			-reset to factory setting/switch off google location services
			-apps are printing to LogCat, but don't update screen
			-mobile phone 100%, switch off eveything else
			-screen on for first half an hour
		-question: how much % is left
		-(first run for half an hour GPS indoor: 98% left)
		-run for 4 hours each
			-90% left for GPS indoor
			-98% left for network-based
			-99% accelerometer
