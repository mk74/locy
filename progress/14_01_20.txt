I have done:
	Research on feedback from last meeting:
		-apps
			-bluetooth 4.0
				-if there are no devices available, it prints out much less things to LogCat
				-more energy-efficient than classics bluetooth
				-^^ showed it in experiments

			-camera
				-iPhone has the same issue, but they overlay this preview <-looked up on the Internet, didn't try myself
				-Google Nexus 7, HTC desire, HTC flyer:
					-Codec H263
					-Resolution	176&144
					-Frame rate		~10(HTC flyer),	~12(HTC desire),	~15(Google Nexus 7)
				-I fixed interesting bug on HTC desire:
					not enough dynamic memory for converting raw preview to given format, but I decreased the preview size and it's fine

			-microphone
				Google Nexus 7:
					-Codec: AMR narrow band(samr)
					-channels: 		mono
					-sample rate:	8000 Hz
					-bits per sample 	32
				HTC desire, HTC flyer:
					-Codec: AMR narrow band(samr)
					-channels:		1
					-sample rate:	8000 Hz
					-bits per sample:	16
					-Bitrate:		128 kb/s

		-report
			-started skeleton for energy measurement section and a big one

		-experiments:
			-found % depletion for:
				 -HTC desire: 89->88; I tried earlier 98->97 and 95->94, but sometimes charging is not triggered if more than 91%
				 -HTC flyer:	98->97 (as discussed earlier, the issue about charging to 100% and depleting very fast through a couple of %)
			-keeping consistency for Bluetooth app
			-finished doing them


	Experiments:
		(show results!)
		first 3 samples, but then decide on 5 samples
		HTC flyer:
			-once, after a series of experiments, the results started dropping - faster battery depletion
		HTC desire: 
			-the results are sometimes doubled?
			-light/proximity results
				-proximity may be based on light
				-it's probably not no_light/light related ?
					- i tried to shown it in experiments

		new idea, experiments - offloading it to cloud, Google Nexus 7:
			-connected accelerometer:	661
			-connected WiFiScan:		601	

		conlusions:
			-physical sensors are alwasy in the group of cheapest 
			-bluetooth - proximity the same, the cheapest group
				exactly what industry does
			-microphone good results as well, people try to utilize it(research community)
				reference to Ambient sound thing
				however it's not always the chepeast
			-"the order" differest among devices
				e.g. microphone is in different category
				gives the reason for online measurement
				diallows the usage of power models
					(need to look further into how they are built)
				related to fragmentation problem?!

			-should i draw any conlusions on order between physical sensors?

	Apps:
		-SensorGraphPlotter -helped app printin live accelerometer data
			-sliding window 5000 gives 2.5 minutes
			-total accerleration magnitude used
		-baseline implementation of indoor localization
			-client: 
				-continous scanning netowork and send results over the web - WifiNavigator
				-battery performance: again 1% battery depletion is being measured
			-backend
				-checks if there is given BSSID in results, if so -> CS network; if not-> no CS network
		-inLocy
			-started skeleton
			-first checks whether user is moving and if yes, WiFINavigator is used
				-algorithm for activity recognition is being copied form EmotionSense



	Concerns/Ideas:
		-accuracy if we provide that we have WiFi fingerprints and mapping function
			-how to compare it with accuracy accelerometer gives?
?		-utility issue in my previous research idea
			no assistance, but location information still may be used in other ways -> predictive intelligence
		-new hypothesis: Android requires different energy measurement than Power model software as fragmentation problem for Android
			-this is crucial in case of physical sensors
			-look more on how power models work?
		-new thought: security concern about user tracking - no need for ask for permision about accleromete/magnetic field etc.
			-does it enable user tracking?

Feedback:
	camera app, need to have preview:
		camera uses additional energy <- speculate as we can't compare
		we are forced to render even if you don't need it
			^^ the reason why i want to have energy aware API

	htc desire, light/proximity sensor
TODO	find out more on that in terms of hardware
			do they have different than in HTC flyer (they were bought by the departament at the same time)
		discussed imitating light/proximity sensor by camera 	

	issue of using bluetooth
		in research community, it is sued for sacnning and proxmity mainly, and not transmitting data
			e.g. detect whether social environment(more people/less people around) is changed

	discussed a bit what kind of sensing could be done with microphone
		"Tapping into the Vibe of the city using VibN, a continuous sesning application for smathphones"


	offloading profiling devices to cloud
		if "the order" differs across mobile phones, profiling could be done in cloud 
			does Google Activity Recognition do it ?
		how to do it without any privacy reveal <- future work section of my dissertation

	talked through test scenarios:
		-baseline:	both are always moving - excatly in the same way -> energy perfomance should be similar
		-another scenario: walking for a while, sitting for a while and so on -> smart solution should be more energy-efficient
		-repeat those experiments across devices

	general "to do":
		-more focused on actual work/output than research
		-write inLocy, activity recognition in it - simple one
		-run two test scenarios across all devices
		-visualize earlier experiments
