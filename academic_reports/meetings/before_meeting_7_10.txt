Raport prior to Meeting 7/10.:
	I have done:
		-read how satellite navigation works/GPS/ mobile phone tracking(trilateration/multilateration/triangulation), accuracy, geofencing
		-read Android: what sensors/ what OS - changes, overview/ activity recognition/fused location provider/ SensorFramework/ android's architecture
		-Read about EmotionSense and extracted part of library which we are interested: AdaptiveSensing.java and SociableSense's paper
		-Run Android:
			-set up environment(decided on Eclipse + ADT, not Android Studio)
			-code HelloWorld(+ java refresher)
			-code list all sensors with power(!) + print Accelerometer's values
			-clone app using ActivityRecognition + make it working on my tablet testing of that, when wifi on/off

	To discuss:
		-Google ActivityRecognition Framework: detect the user's current physical activity, such as walking, driving, or standing still.
			-I know how it is used in Maps
			-but don't know whether uses the internet
			-What's our approach towards this project?

	I want to spend more time on :
		-Google ActivityRecognition, fused Location provider and sensor framework, library development on Android
			-playing and reading
		-reading papers:
			SenseLess, SociableSense hopefully a couple more
		-Physics behind GPS:
			-altitude(accuracy, point of reference to the earth)
		-Indoor positioning system
