\subsection{Sensors energy measurements}

\plot{google_nexus_7}

\plot{htc_flyer}

\plot{htc_desire}

Those results are intuitive and overlap with other research.
	plain run is the most energy-efficient, camera and gps are the most energy 
	
	This gives validation for the energy measurement method.

The API issue: Bluetooth vs Bluetooth LTE\\
	new functionality-> prints a lot of logs -> not energy-efficient\\				
				
"the order" differs among devices\\
	gives the reason for online measurement\\
	disallows the usage of power models\\
		(need to look further into how they are built)\\
		related to fragmentation problem?!\\

physical sensors are relative cheap group of sensors \\
	however the difference is not so big,
		reasons: IPC, continuous sampling
			it gives better functionality; is more complex; uses more energy
		result: smart sampling of physical sensors needs to be leveraged
			-validates why people do duty-cycling, adaptive sampling
	also don't know the cost when they are combined
		characteristics of cost? -> is it just CPU ?
			how WIFi and acceleromter vs wifi performs?
			how accelerometer and gyroscope vs acceleterometer performs?
				-intuition is that the result will not be much higher
		
		
\subsubsection{Localization}

The diagram of results across many devices for: camera, gps, wifi, microphone, bluetooth, bluetooth LE

WiFI is cheaper than GPS
	reason why peoplpe prefer one over another				
				
microphone good results, people try to utilize it(research community)\\
				SurroundSense \cite{azizyan:surroundsense}\\
				however it's not always the cheapest\\
	
Bluetooth - is the cheapest in comparison to others
				exactly what industry does\\
				Bluetooth LE even accelerates those efforts
				References to beacons etc.\\
				(requires infrastructure)
				
Another on maybe computer vision, but:				\\
	Camera is the most expensive, and thus, not used yet for localization.\\
	
			
								
\subsection{Sensy}
\subsection{Conclusions}
Sensor energy measurements:
	-validation for the method
	-different results -> reason why power model can't be used

Physical sensors:
	provide more complex functionality, uses more energy
		require different strategies of using those "simple" sensors

Results for localization: 
	-results explains why industry goes about it
		-reiterate?
		-indicates what future is about Bluetooth LE vs camera
