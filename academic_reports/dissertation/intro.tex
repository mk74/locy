\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}
\hspace{10pt} Smartphones are widely used devices, which provide \textbf{advanced services based on a user's context} e.g. a restaurant may be recommended basing on his current location \cite{foursquare:foursquare}. Beside localization, there are other relevant context information. Recently, the Apple's patent was granted for variable device graphical user interface \cite{uspatent:apple}. The patent describes the interface that is adjusted depending on what kind of phone motion is detected e.g. icons may be bigger while a user is running. Information on physical activity is also utilized in health mobile applications. Accupedo Pedometer \cite{googleplay:accupedo} monitors a user's daily walking to estimate his calories burned. Furthermore, other context information is widely used in research community e.g. speech detection and Bluetooth proximity may help in quantifying social interactions \cite{rachuri:socialsense}. Lastly, the context is likely to redefine mobile operating systems. The functionality of a mobile phone may be adaptive depending on a user's context e.g. a user may not be interested in bus timetable if he is driving a car. Google Now \cite{google:googlenow} tries to leverage that context information to provide a user "with right information at the just the right time".

\textbf{The context is inferred as a result of the phone sensing process}. It consists of acquiring raw sensor data and extracting a relevant information out of them. For example, accelerometer data may indicate that the user is not moving. Modern mobile phones are rich in sensors. Google Nexus 7 is not only equipped with standard sensors such as microphone, camera, IEEE 802.11, GPS, Bluetooth or accelerometer, but also magnetic field, gyroscope or ambient light. All of those sensors may be sampled and provide raw sensor data from which meaningful information could be obtained. This process usually involves feature extraction and classification. Different features may be useful depending on a sensor and a type of information we want to obtain e.g., the number of peaks in accelerometer data may be a good predictor to answer whether an user is walking or running. The classification is an inference, which assigns a high-level class to feature vector e.g., 2 peaks in one second is interpreted as a user is walking.

\textbf{Battery life is of key importance to mobile phone users}. Modern mobile applications complex functionality, which results in higher energy demands. Without any significant progress in battery hardware technology, energy consumption is one of the most crucial problems in mobile systems.

Without any significant progress in battery technology, battery lifetime is the most important concern of modern mobile systems.

\textbf{Phone sensing may lead to fast battery depletion}. Both phases of phone sensing incur additional energy costs. Simple physical sensor are energy-efficient themselves, but their careless sampling may result in high energy consumption. For example, while accelerometer is being sampled, high-power components including CPU are active which may significantly drain the battery life \cite{priyantha:littlerock}. For other sensors like camera or GPS, the sampling itself is an expensive operation \cite{benabdesslem:senseless}. Also, the data extraction process is computationally intensive, which means high energy demand \cite{musolesi:offloading}.

\textbf{In mobile phone sensing, there is a specific energy-accuracy tradeoff.} Energy efficiency of mobile sensing may be improved while decreasing the accuracy of the context information. For example, we could sense GPS less often. This would result in energy savings, but the location coordinates could be inaccurate during the periods when GPS is not being sampled.

\textbf{This project investigates an energy-accuracy tradeoff in phone sensing}. It reviews the current state of the art and identifies possible enhancements. Also, the unique method of energy measurement is proposed and used to determine energy profiles of different sensors available across different devices. As a proof of concept, the energy efficient sensing library was built, which embodies the ideas presented in this dissertation.
