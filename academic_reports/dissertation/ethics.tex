\section{Ethics}
\label{s:ethics}

\hspace{10pt} \textbf{The project did not raise any ethical considerations}. Initially, I believed that the study with real users will need to be conducted. The algorithm of the energy-efficient library could be dependent on the specific user. In that case, the performance of the library would need to be validated in the experiments with other real users. As the project progressed, it turned out that the library is independent to an user. Therefore, the experiments involving only myself were sufficient to validate the performance of the library. The preliminary ethics considerations were analyzed in \textbf{Preliminary Ethics Self-Assessment Form, which is attached in Appendix \ref{s:ethicsform}}.
