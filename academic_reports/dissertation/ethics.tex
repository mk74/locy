\section{Ethics}
\label{s:ethics}
\hspace{10pt} \textbf{The project did not raise any ethical considerations}. Initially, it was believed that the study with real users needs to be conducted to verify the performance of energy-efficient sensing library, Locy. If the algorithm were dependent on the specific behavior of a user, the performance of the library would need to be validated in the experiments with real users. As the project progressed, it turned out that the library's algorithm is independent to a user's behavior. Therefore, the experiments involving only myself were sufficient to validate the performance of the library. The preliminary ethics considerations were analyzed in \textbf{Preliminary Ethics Self-Assessment Form, which is attached in Appendix \ref{s:ethicsform}}.
