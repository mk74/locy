\subsection{Energy measurement}
\hspace{10pt} To improve energy-efficiency of sensing, an accurate method of measuring power consumption needs to be established. This task is relatively easy for Nokia phones. Nokia Energy Profiler \cite{nokia:profiler}, an application delivered by Nokia,  accurately measures power consumption and is widely used by research community \cite{kjaergaard:entracked} \cite{lu:jigsaw} \cite{li:status}. However, Google does not provide an equivalent application for Android smartphones, which makes the task difficult.

The Power Monitor is a hardware power meter delivered by MoonSooon PowerSolutions \cite{monsoon:powermonitor}.  It is designed for analyzing power of single lithium\ (Li) batteries (all Android phones). Although the tool provides accurate measurements, it can only be used in lab environment e.g., it can't measure energy consumption of GPS sampling while a client is moving outdoor. It is also expensive, and thus, it can't be directly used by mobile phone clients. To easy this problem, mobile phone vendors establish power profiles and provide them on mobile phones \cite{android:powerprofiles}. This information may be further utilized by software power profilers.

Software power profilers on Android smartphones use a power model to determine current energy consumption. They continuously query states of hardware components such as CPU, wireless card or screen. For example, wireless card may be switched off, listen or send information. Each state of every component has its corresponding energy consumption. This value is available in power profiles provided by a mobile phone vendor as described in the previous paragraph. Software power profilers aggregate all of those energy values to estimate current energy consumption of a device. Example applications using this method includes PowerTutor \cite{zhang:powertutor} and Battery Monitor Widget \cite{googleplay:batterymonitorwidget}. Although this method provides online energy measurement and is can by used by customers, those measurements are often inaccurate. With time, the power profiles, provided by vendors, can change as battery characteristics do [XXX references]. Furthermore, they are not applicable to phone sensing: power profiles are often not available for physical sensors.
