\section{Conclusions}
\label{s:conc}
Context survey conclusions \\
	-critically reviewed three most important areas for the project:
		-phone sensing, energy measurement methods(results), energy-efficient sensing
	-in each of them the possible enhancement was identified
	-(big data set, hybrid approached to energy-efficient phone sensing)
	-most importantly, the energy method was chosen suitable for the research
		-plus the improvement over it

Sensor Energy measurement's method:\\
	-design novel way of investigating energy efficiency\\
	-checked it in practice, identify its problems\\
	-the method is validated since the results are compared with other research\\
	-specific characteristics of the batteries:
		-wrong samples
		-energy efficiency levels
	-cons:\\
		-the method is instable for older batteries \\
			-and thus cannot be used as online measurement, as it is not practical (too many samples )\\
	
	
Sensor Energy measurement's results:\\
	-complete set of results across three different phones including all sensors\\
		-it is believed that the first one like this\\
	-different energy characteristics across different devices\\
		->reason for online measurement, invalidate power models\\
	-the evolution of sensors for localization services\\
	-cons:\\
		-limited information on nature of energy consumption:\\
			"combined sensors" -> how they are going to perform?\\
			-no different parameters for phones are checked:\\
				-no duty cycling checked, no different periods/sleeping intervals checked\\
	-those results are used to design the energy-efficient algorithms for the library:\\
		-sensor substitution as cheaper sensor may be leveraged to replace heavy-duty sensors\\
	
Locy, the energy-efficient sensing library the design:\\
	-leverage sensors
		-moving detection algorithm
			-standard deviation, three windows
	-duty-cycling in order sensing to be more energy-efficient
		-differentiate it depending on battery level
	-easily plugged to exsisting applications
		behave as Android APi, requires just one single line change
		example ESM.
	
Locy, the evaluation: \\
	compare against baseline implementation
	two scenarios, three different devices
	Locy is more energy-efficient
	should convince a reader that it is worth incorporating

Future work as well\\
	extensions of the library:
		inLocy
		Library as a service could be compared
		+ evaluation
	other idea for optimization:
		leveraging the history for sensing
