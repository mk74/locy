\section{Conclusions}
\label{s:conc}


Sensor Energy measurement's method:
	-design novel way of investigating energy efficiency
	-checked it in practice, 
		-identify its problems
	-realize that it could be use in limited environment
	-the method is validated as results are compared with other research
	
	
Sensor Energy measurement's results:
	
	-the evolution of sensors for localization services
	
	
The energy-efficient library:
