\section{Conclusions}
\label{s:conc}
XXX here on context survey conlusions \\

Sensor Energy measurement's method:\\
	-design novel way of investigating energy efficiency\\
	-checked it in practice, identify its problems\\
	-the method is validated since the results are compared with other research\\
	-cons:\\
		-the method is instable for older batteries \\
			-and thus cannot be used as online measurement, as it is not practical (too many samples )\\
	
	
Sensor Energy measurement's results:\\
	-complete set of results across three different phones including all sensors\\
		-it is believed that the first one like this\\
	-different energy characteristics across different devices\\
		->reason for online measurement, invalidate power models\\
	-the evolution of sensors for localization services\\
	-cons:\\
		-limited information on nature of energy consumption:\\
			"combined sensors" -> how they are going to perform?\\
			-no different parameters for phones are checked:\\
				-no duty cycling checked, no different periods/sleeping intervals checked\\
	-those results are used to design the energy-efficient algorithms for the library:\\
		-sensor substitution as cheaper sensor may be leveraged to replace heavy-duty sensors\\
	
Sensy, the energy-efficient library:\\
