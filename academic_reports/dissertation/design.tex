\subsection{Sensors energy measurements}

(Generally: What I wanted to build and how I wanted to build it)\\
\\
Aim: compare sensors energy consumption\\

what to compare:\\
	-separate apps\\
	-each switch off all sensors beside one is being currently investigated\\
	-minimize other differences \\
		-reason: could add noise/demolish results  if otherwise
		-sensor sampling frequency differences\\
			-background\\
				-802.11 scanning\\
					Bluetooth\\
				-GPS\\
				-physical sensors\\
			-solution\\
				(the worst possible scenario)\\
				choose the smallest frequency, but which provides complete information\\
					e.g. we could scan WiFi every half a sec, but complete scan take around 2,5 sec.\\
				as often as possible:\\
					physical sensors\\
					camera, microphone, GPS\\	
				new scan when previous finished\\
					WiFI, Bluetooth, Bluetooth BLE\\
		-standardized output\\
				-its frequency\\
					results will come on different frequencies\\
					but they are printed on the same frequency\\
						even if there are no new results\\
				-how it looks like\\
					WiFi Scan results look different (20 records) than light sensor (1 int)\\
					solution:\\
						standardized to "values: int int int" or "values: int"
							e.g. Wireless scanning(WiFi, Bluetooth, Bluetooth LTE) only shows number of records\\
							show example\\	
		-hope to only measure what we want to measure\\				
				
how to compare:\\
	measure how long it takes to deplete 1% of battery life\\
		measure on exactly the same percentage across different apps\\
		make a couple of samples, average and compare\\
		reasons:\\
			people measure the whole battery life, but takes too long\\
		predictions:\\
			the battery life is nonlinear, but we hope that the behaviour on the the same percentage will be the same.\\
			we hope that those measurements will be repetitive and similar.\\
			measurement will not take long\\
			1% is accuracy which Android API gives\\
