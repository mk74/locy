Introduction
	why?
		why smartphones?
		more and more context-aware applications
		advanced services
			example simple
			example research
			example industry
		but use energy

	mobile sensing definition
		process:
			fetch raw coordinates
			extract a feature
			do a reasoning
			result meaningful infromation
			example
		sensors definition

	energy-accuracy tradeoff
		energy efficiency
		example

	what is my work?
		investigates the energy-accuracy tradeoff in phone sensing
	key aspects of my work
		it reviews the current state of the art and identifies possible enhancements
		propose uniq way of measuring battery life
			establish energy efficiency order among different devices 
		the energy efficient sensing library
			which also prototypes some of the enhancments  

Objectives
	the research:
		context survey
		new ideas/enhancment
	the library as the result of that
