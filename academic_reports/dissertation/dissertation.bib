    abstract = {{A large number of context-inference applications run on off-the-shelf smart-phones and infer context from the data acquired by means of the sensors embedded in these devices. The use of efficient and effective sampling technique is of key importance for these applications. Aggressive sampling can ensure a more fine-grained and accurate reconstruction of context information but, at the same time, continuous querying of sensor data might lead to rapid battery depletion. In this paper, we present an adaptive sensor sampling methodology which relies on dynamic selection of sampling functions depending on history of context events. We also report on the experimental evaluation a set of functions that control the rate at which the data are sensed from the Bluetooth device, accelerometer and microphone sensors and we show that a dynamic adaptation mechanism provides a better trade-offs compared to simpler function based rate control methods. Furthermore, we show that the suitability of these mechanisms varies for each of the sensors, and the accuracy and energy consumption values stabilise after reaching a certain level.}},

Currently, sampling and processing sensor data on the phone requires the main processor and associated components to be continuously on, creating a large energy overhead that can severely impact the battery lifetime of the phone. We will demonstrate Little Rock, a novel sensing architecture for mobile phones, where sampling and, when possible, processing of sensor data is offloaded to a dedicated low-power processor. This approach enables the phone to perform continuous sensing three orders of magnitude more energy efficiently compared to the normal approaches.}},

@inproceedings{kjaergaard:entracked,
    abstract = {{An important feature of a modern mobile device is that it can position itself. Not only for use on the device but also for remote applications that require tracking of the device. To be useful, such position tracking has to be energy-efficient to avoid having a major impact on the battery life of the mobile device. Furthermore, tracking has to robustly deliver position updates when faced with changing conditions such as delays due to positioning and communication, and changing positioning accuracy. This work proposes EnTracked - a system that, based on the estimation and prediction of system conditions and mobility, schedules position updates to both minimize energy consumption and optimize robustness. The realized system tracks pedestrian targets equipped with GPS-enabled devices. The system is configurable to realize different trade-offs between energy consumption and robustness. We provide extensive experimental results by profiling how devices consume power, by emulation on collected data and by validation in several real-world deployments. Results from this profiling show how a device consumes power while tracking its position. Results from the emulation indicate that the system can estimate and predict system conditions and mobility. Furthermore they provide evidence for that the system can lower the energy consumption considerably and remain robust when faced with changing system conditions. By validation in several real-world deployments we provide evidence that the real system works as predicted by the emulation.}},

We present the design, implementation and evaluation of the Jigsaw continuous sensing engine, which balances the performance needs of the application and the resource demands of continuous sensing on the phone. Jigsaw comprises a set of sensing pipelines for the accelerometer, microphone and GPS sensors, which are built in a plug and play manner to support: i) resilient accelerometer data processing, which allows inferences to be robust to different phone hardware, orientation and body positions; ii) smart admission control and on-demand processing for the microphone and accelerometer data, which adaptively throttles the depth and sophistication of sensing pipelines when the input data is low quality or uninformative; and iii) adaptive pipeline processing, which judiciously triggers power hungry pipeline stages (e.g., sampling the GPS) taking into account the mobility and behavioral patterns of the user to drive down energy costs. We implement and evaluate Jigsaw on the Nokia N95 and the Apple iPhone, two popular smartphone platforms, to demonstrate its capability to recognize user activities and perform long term GPS tracking in an energy-efficient manner.}},

@article{li:status,
    abstract = {{With the prevalence of smart mobile devices with multiple sensors, the commercial application of intelligent context-aware services becomes more and more attractive. However, limited by the battery capacity, the energy efficiency of context-sensing is the bottleneck for the success of context-aware applications. Though several previous studies for energy-efficient context-sensing have been reported, none of them can be applied to multiple types of high-energy-consuming sensors. Moreover, applying machine learning technologies to energy-efficient context-sensing is underexplored too. In this article, we propose to leverage machine learning technologies for improving the energy efficiency of multiple high-energy-consuming context sensors by trading off the sensing accuracy. To be specific, we try to infer the status of high-energy-consuming sensors according to the outputs of software-based sensors and the physical sensors that are necessary to work all the time for supporting the basic functions of mobile devices. If the inference indicates the high-energy-consuming sensor is in a stable status, we avoid the unnecessary invocation and instead use the latest invoked value as the estimation. The experimental results on real datasets show that the energy efficiency of GPS sensing and audio-level sensing are significantly improved by the proposed approach while the sensing accuracy is over 90\&percnt;.}},
