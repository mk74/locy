    abstract = {{Continuously understanding a user's location context in colloquial terms and the paths that connect the locations unlocks many opportunities for emerging applications. While extensive research effort has been made on efficiently tracking a user's raw coordinates, few attempts have been made to efficiently provide everyday contextual information about these locations as places and paths. We introduce SensLoc, a practical location service to provide such contextual information, abstracting location as place visits and path travels from sensor signals. SensLoc comprises of a robust place detection algorithm, a sensitive movement detector, and an on-demand path tracker. Based on a user's mobility, SensLoc proactively controls active cycle of a GPS receiver, a WiFi scanner, and an accelerometer. Pilot studies show that SensLoc can correctly detect 94\% of the place visits, track 95\% of the total travel distance, and still only consume 13\% of energy than algorithms that periodically collect coordinates to provide the same information.}},

@article{Kwapisz2011,
    abstract = {{Mobile devices are becoming increasingly sophisticated and the latest generation of smart cell phones now incorporates many diverse and powerful sensors. These sensors include GPS sensors, vision sensors (i.e., cameras), audio sensors (i.e., microphones), light sensors, temperature sensors, direction sensors (i.e., magnetic compasses), and acceleration sensors (i.e., accelerometers). The availability of these sensors in mass-marketed communication devices creates exciting new opportunities for data mining and data mining applications. In this paper we describe and evaluate a system that uses phone-based accelerometers to perform activity recognition, a task which involves identifying the physical activity a user is performing. To implement our system we collected labeled accelerometer data from twenty-nine users as they performed daily activities such as walking, jogging, climbing stairs, sitting, and standing, and then aggregated this time series data into examples that summarize the user activity over 10- second intervals. We then used the resulting training data to induce a predictive model for activity recognition. This work is significant because the activity recognition model permits us to gain useful knowledge about the habits of millions of users passively---just by having them carry cell phones in their pockets. Our work has a wide range of applications, including automatic customization of the mobile device's behavior based upon a user's activity (e.g., sending calls directly to voicemail if a user is jogging) and generating a daily/weekly activity profile to determine if a user (perhaps an obese child) is performing a healthy amount of exercise.}},

Sensing presence captures a user's status in terms of his activity (e.g., sitting, walking, meeting friends), disposition (e.g., happy, sad, doing {OK}), habits (e.g., at the gym, coffee shop today, at work) and surroundings (e.g., noisy, hot, bright, high ozone). {CenceMe} injects sensing presence into popular social networking applications such as Facebook, {MySpace}, and {IM} (Skype, Pidgin) allowing for new levels of "connection" and implicit communication (albeit non-verbal) between friends in social networks. The {CenceMe} system is implemented, in part, as a thin-client on a number of standard and sensor-enabled cell phones and offers a number of services, which can be activated on a per-buddy basis to expose different degrees of a user's sensing presence; these services include, life patterns, my presence, friend feeds, social interaction, significant places, buddy search, buddy beacon, and "above average?".},

applications. With the constrained battery on cell phones, energy-efficient
localization becomes an important challenge. In this paper we introduce a
low-energy calibration-free localization scheme based on the available internal
sensors in many of today's phones. We start by energy profiling the different
sensors that can be used for localization. Based on that, we propose GAC: a
hybrid GPS/accelerometer/compass scheme that depends mainly on using the
low-energy accelerometer and compass sensors and uses the GPS infrequently for
synchronization. We implemented our system on Android-enabled cell phones and
evaluated it in both highways and intra-city driving environments. Our results
show that the proposed hybrid scheme has an exponential saving in energy, with
a linear loss in accuracy compared to the GPS accuracy. We also evaluate the
effect of the different parameters on the energy-accuracy tradeoff.}},

The use of efficient and effective sampling technique is of key importance for these applications. Aggressive sampling can ensure a more fine-grained and accurate reconstruction of context information but, at the same time, continuous querying of sensor data might lead to rapid battery depletion. In this paper, we present an adaptive sensor sampling methodology which relies on dynamic selection of sampling functions depending on history of context events. We also report on the experimental evaluation a set of functions that control the rate at which the data are sensed from the Bluetooth device, accelerometer and microphone sensors and we show that a dynamic adaptation mechanism provides a better trade-offs compared to simpler function based rate control methods. Furthermore, we show that the suitability of these mechanisms varies for each of the sensors, and the accuracy and energy consumption values stabilise after reaching a certain level.}},

@inproceedings{deshpande:coordinated,
    abstract = {{Wireless networks are deployed in home, university, business, military and hospital environments, and are increasingly used for mission-critical applications like VoIP or financial applications. Monitoring the health of these networks, whether it is for failure, coverage or attacks, is important in terms of security, connectivity, cost, and performance. Effective monitoring of wireless network traffic, using commodity hardware, is a challenging task due to the limitations of the hardware. IEEE 802.11 networks support multiple channels, and a wireless interface can monitor only a single channel at one time. Thus, capturing all frames passing an interface on all channels is an impossible task, and we need strategies to capture the most representative sample.  When a large geographic area is to be monitored, several monitoring stations must be deployed, and these will typically overlap in their area of coverage. The competing goals of effective wireless monitoring are to capture as many frames as possible, while minimizing the number of those frames that are captured redundantly by more than one monitoring station. Both goals may be addressed with a sampling strategy that directs neighboring monitoring stations to different channels during any period. To be effective, such a strategy requires timely access to the nature of all recent traffic. We propose a coordinated sampling strategy that meets these goals. Our implemented solution involves a central controller considering traffic characteristics from many monitoring stations to periodically develop specific sampling policies for each station. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our coordinated sampling strategy by comparing it with existing independent strategies. Our coordinated strategy enabled more distinct frames to be captured, providing a solid foundation for focused sampling and intrusion detection.}},

@article{deshpande:refocusing,
    abstract = {{The edge of the Internet is increasingly wireless. To understand the Internet, one must understand the edge, and yet the measurement of wireless networks poses many new challenges. IEEE 802.11 networks support multiple wireless channels and any monitoring technique involves capturing traffic on each of these channels to gather a representative sample of frames from the network. We call this procedure channel sampling, in which each sniffer visits each channel periodically, resulting in a sample of the traffic on each of the channels. This sampling approach may be sufficient, for example, for a system administrator or anomaly detection module to observe some unusual behavior in the network. Once an anomaly is detected, however, the administrator may require a more extensive traffic sample, or need to identify the location of an offending device. We propose a method to allow measurement applications to dynamically modify the sampling strategy, refocusing the monitoring system to pay more attention to certain types of traffic than others. In this paper we show that refocusing is a necessary and promising new technique for wireless measurement.}},

Deploying wireless sniffers to monitor every access point in an enterprise network, however, may be expensive or impractical. Moreover, some applications may require the deployment of multiple sniffers to monitor the numerous channels in an 802.11 network. In this paper, we explore sampling strategies for monitoring multiple channels in 802.11b/g networks. We describe a simple sampling strategy, where each channel is observed for an equal, predetermined length of time, and consider applications where such a strategy might be appropriate. We then introduce a sampling strategy that weights the time spent on each channel according to the number of frames observed on that channel, and compare the two strategies under experimental conditions.}},

    abstract = {{A variety of cutting edge applications for mobile phones exploit the availability of phone sensors to accurately infer the user activity and location to offer more effective services. To validate and evaluate these new applications, appropriate and extensive datasets are needed: in particular, large sets of traces of sensor data (accelerometer, GPS, micro- phone, etc.), labelled with corresponding user activities. So far, such traces have only been collected in short-lived, small-scale setups. The primary reason for this is the difficulty in establishing accurate ground truth information outside the laboratory. Here, we present our vision of a system for large-scale sensor data capturing, leveraging all sensors of todays smart phones, with the aim of generating a large dataset that is augmented with appropriate ground-truth information. The primary challenges that we address consider the energy cost on the mobile device and the incentives for users to keep running the system on their device for longer. We argue for leveraging the concept of the checkin - as successfully introduced in online social networks (e.g. Foursquare) - for collecting activity and context related datasets. With a checkin, a user deliberately provides a small piece of data about their behaviour while enabling the system to adjust sensing and data collection around important activities. In this work we present up2, a mobile app letting users check in to their current activity (e.g., "waiting for the bus", "riding a bicycle", "having dinner"). After a checkin, we use the phone's sensors (GPS, accelerometer, microphone, etc.) to gather data about the user's activity and surrounding. This makes up2 a valuable tool for research in sensor based activity detection.}},

We compare our two-tier classifier to (i) a conventional single-tier classifier, and (ii) a confidence-based multi-tier classifier designed to reduce wake time. We evaluate our approaches using activity-labeled smartphone accelerometer data traces from 2 subjects over a total of 60 hours performing 7 different physical activities.

In this paper, we introduce SmartDC, a mobility prediction-based adaptive duty cycling scheme to provide contextual information about a user's mobility: time-resolved places and paths. Unlike previous approaches that focused on minimizing energy consumption for tracking raw coordinates, we propose efficient techniques to maximize the accuracy of monitoring meaningful places with a given energy constraint. SmartDC comprises unsupervised mobility learner, mobility predictor, and Markov decision process-based adaptive duty cycling. SmartDC estimates the regularity of individual mobility and predicts residence time at places to determine efficient sensing schedules. Our experiment results show that SmartDC consumes 81\% less energy than the periodic sensing schemes, and 87\% less energy than a scheme employing context-aware sensing, yet it still correctly monitors 80\% of a user's location changes within a 160-second delay.}},

The framework characterizes the optimal localization accuracy for a given energy budget, and develops prediction- based heuristics for real-time use. Evaluation on traces from real users demonstrates the possibility of achieving good localization accuracy for a realistic energy budget.}},

@inproceedings{Wang:unsupervised,
    abstract = {{We propose UnLoc, an unsupervised indoor localization scheme that bypasses the need for war-driving. Our key observation is that certain locations in an indoor environment present identifiable signatures on one or more sensing dimensions. An elevator, for instance, imposes a distinct pattern on a smartphone's accelerometer; a corridor-corner may overhear a unique set of WiFi access points; a specific spot may experience an unusual magnetic fluctuation. We hypothesize that these kind of signatures naturally exist in the environment, and can be envisioned as internal landmarks of a building. Mobile devices that "sense" these landmarks can recalibrate their locations, while dead-reckoning schemes can track them between landmarks. Results from 3 different indoor settings, including a shopping mall, demonstrate median location errors of 1:69m. War-driving is not necessary, neither are floorplans the system simultaneously computes the locations of users and landmarks, in a manner that they converge reasonably quickly. We believe this is an unconventional approach to indoor localization, holding promise for real-world deployment.}},

The idea is not fundamentally different from ship or air navigation systems, known for centuries. Nonetheless, directly applying the idea to human-scale environments is non-trivial. Noisy phone sensors and complicated human movements present practical research challenges. We cope with these challenges by recording a person's walking patterns, and matching it against possible path signatures generated from a local electronic map. Electronic maps enable greater coverage, while eliminating the reliance on WiFi infrastructure and expensive war-driving.

Structuring localization systems "organically," however, introduces its own set of challenges: conveying uncertainty, determining when user input is actually required, and discounting erroneous and stale data. Through deployment of an organic location system in our nine-story building, which contains nearly 1,400 distinct spaces, we evaluate new algorithms for addressing these challenges. We describe the use of Voronoi regions for conveying uncertainty and reasoning about gaps in coverage, and a clustering method for identifying potentially erroneous user data.

    abstract = {{We propose ACE (Acquisitional Context Engine), a middleware that supports continuous context-aware applications while mitigating sensing costs for inferring contexts. ACE provides user's current context to applications running on it. In addition, it dynamically learns relationships among various context attributes (e.g., whenever the user is Driving, he is not AtHome). ACE exploits these automatically learned relationships for two powerful optimizations. The first is inference caching that allows ACE to opportunistically infer one context attribute (AtHome) from another already-known attribute (Driving), without acquiring any sensor data. The second optimization is speculative sensing that enables ACE to occasionally infer the value of an expensive attribute (e.g., AtHome) by sensing cheaper attributes (e.g., Driving). Our experiments with two real context traces of 105 people and a Windows Phone prototype show that ACE can reduce sensing costs of three context-aware applications by about 4.2x, compared to a raw sensor data cache shared across applications, with a very small memory and processing overhead.}},

@inproceedings{azizyan:surroundsense,
    abstract = {{A growing number of mobile computing applications are centered around the user's location. The notion of location is broad, ranging from physical coordinates (latitude/longitude) to logical labels (like Starbucks, McDonalds). While extensive research has been performed in physical localization, there have been few attempts in recognizing logical locations. This paper argues that the increasing number of sensors on mobile phones presents new opportunities for logical localization. We postulate that ambient sound, light, and color in a place convey a photo-acoustic signature that can be sensed by the phone's camera and microphone. In-built accelerometers in some phones may also be useful in inferring broad classes of user-motion, often dictated by the nature of the place. By combining these optical, acoustic, and motion attributes, it may be feasible to construct an identifiable fingerprint for logical localization. Hence, users in adjacent stores can be separated logically, even when their physical positions are extremely close. We propose  SurroundSense,  a mobile phone based system that explores logical localization via ambience fingerprinting. Evaluation results from 51 different stores show that SurroundSense can achieve an average accuracy of 87\% when all sensing modalities are employed. We believe this is an encouraging result, opening new possibilities in indoor localization.}},

@inproceedings{kjaergaard:entracked,
    abstract = {{An important feature of a modern mobile device is that it can position itself. Not only for use on the device but also for remote applications that require tracking of the device. To be useful, such position tracking has to be energy-efficient to avoid having a major impact on the battery life of the mobile device. Furthermore, tracking has to robustly deliver position updates when faced with changing conditions such as delays due to positioning and communication, and changing positioning accuracy. This work proposes EnTracked - a system that, based on the estimation and prediction of system conditions and mobility, schedules position updates to both minimize energy consumption and optimize robustness. The realized system tracks pedestrian targets equipped with GPS-enabled devices. The system is configurable to realize different trade-offs between energy consumption and robustness. We provide extensive experimental results by profiling how devices consume power, by emulation on collected data and by validation in several real-world deployments. Results from this profiling show how a device consumes power while tracking its position. Results from the emulation indicate that the system can estimate and predict system conditions and mobility. Furthermore they provide evidence for that the system can lower the energy consumption considerably and remain robust when faced with changing system conditions. By validation in several real-world deployments we provide evidence that the real system works as predicted by the emulation.}},

There is evidence that groups of users that interact more in workplaces are more productive. However, it is still hard for social scientists to capture fine-grained data about phenomena of this kind and to find the right means to facilitate interaction. It is also difficult for users to keep track of their level of sociability with colleagues. While mobile phones offer a fantastic platform for harvesting long term and fine grained data, they also pose challenges: battery power is limited and needs to be traded-off for sensor reading accuracy and data transmission, while energy costs in processing computationally intensive tasks are high. In this paper, we propose {SociableSense}, a smart phones based platform that captures user behavior in office environments, while providing the users with a quantitative measure of their sociability and that of colleagues. We tackle the technical challenges of building such a tool: the system provides an adaptive sampling mechanism as well as models to decide whether to perform computation of tasks, such as the execution of classification and inference algorithms, locally or remotely. We perform several micro-benchmark tests to fine-tune and evaluate the performance of these mechanisms and we show that the adaptive sampling and computation distribution schemes balance trade-offs among accuracy, energy, latency, and data traffic. Finally, by means of a social psychological study with ten participants for two working weeks, we demonstrate that {SociableSense} fosters interactions among the participants and helps in enhancing their sociability.},

However, limited by the battery capacity, the energy efficiency of context-sensing is the bottleneck for the success of context-aware applications. Though several previous studies for energy-efficient context-sensing have been reported, none of them can be applied to multiple types of high-energy-consuming sensors. Moreover, applying machine learning technologies to energy-efficient context-sensing is underexplored too. In this article, we propose to leverage machine learning technologies for improving the energy efficiency of multiple high-energy-consuming context sensors by trading off the sensing accuracy. To be specific, we try to infer the status of high-energy-consuming sensors according to the outputs of software-based sensors and the physical sensors that are necessary to work all the time for supporting the basic functions of mobile devices. If the inference indicates the high-energy-consuming sensor is in a stable status, we avoid the unnecessary invocation and instead use the latest invoked value as the estimation. The experimental results on real datasets show that the energy efficiency of GPS sensing and audio-level sensing are significantly improved by the proposed approach while the sensing accuracy is over 90\&percnt;.}},
