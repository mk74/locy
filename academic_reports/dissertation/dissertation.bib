@electronic{rachuri:dynamicsensing,
    abstract = {{A large number of context-inference applications run on off-the-shelf smart-phones and infer context from the data acquired by means of the sensors embedded in these devices. The use of efficient and effective sampling technique is of key importance for these applications. Aggressive sampling can ensure a more fine-grained and accurate reconstruction of context information but, at the same time, continuous querying of sensor data might lead to rapid battery depletion. In this paper, we present an adaptive sensor sampling methodology which relies on dynamic selection of sampling functions depending on history of context events. We also report on the experimental evaluation a set of functions that control the rate at which the data are sensed from the Bluetooth device, accelerometer and microphone sensors and we show that a dynamic adaptation mechanism provides a better trade-offs compared to simpler function based rate control methods. Furthermore, we show that the suitability of these mechanisms varies for each of the sensors, and the accuracy and energy consumption values stabilise after reaching a certain level.}},

@inproceedings{priyantha:littlerock,
    abstract = {{Although mobile phones are ideal platforms for continuous human centric sensing, the state of the art phone architectures today have not been designed to support continuous sensing applications. Currently, sampling and processing sensor data on the phone requires the main processor and associated components to be continuously on, creating a large energy overhead that can severely impact the battery lifetime of the phone. We will demonstrate Little Rock, a novel sensing architecture for mobile phones, where sampling and, when possible, processing of sensor data is offloaded to a dedicated low-power processor. This approach enables the phone to perform continuous sensing three orders of magnitude more energy efficiently compared to the normal approaches.}},

@inproceedings{zhang:powertutor,
    abstract = {{This paper describes PowerBooter, an automated power model construction technique that uses built-in battery voltage sensors and knowledge of battery discharge behavior to monitor power consumption while explicitly controlling the power management and activity states of individual components. It requires no external measurement equipment. We also describe PowerTutor, a component power management and activity state introspection based tool that uses the model generated by PowerBooter for online power estimation. PowerBooter is intended to make it quick and easy for application developers and end users to generate power models for new smartphone variants, which each have different power consumption properties and therefore require different power models. PowerTutor is intended to ease the design and selection of power efficient software for embedded systems. Combined, PowerBooter and PowerTutor have the goal of opening power modeling and analysis for more smartphone variants and their users.}},
