-the area
	phone sensing
	energy important
	energy efficiency in  phone sensing

-the problem it addresses
	minor: accurate energy measurement
	major: energy-efficient localization services
	

-what have been done, what have been obtained
	novel energy efficient method 
	 	which provides the complete set of the results across three different mobile phones
	 	believed to be the the first study of this type
	the energy-efficient library was built
		leverage accelerometer (movement detection) to optimize GPS sampling
		adopts its behavior to the battery life of a device
		easy to plug into existing applications
		evaluation:
			tested in two real life scenarios
			performs better than naive implementations twice

-what does it mean
	new method of energy efficient methods
	first complete study of this type, the results may be leveraged for other studies
	Locy - energy efficient library 
		provides the same functionality as Android API
		but it is more energy efficient
		crucial for users
