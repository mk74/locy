\section{Implementation}
\label{s:implementation}
\hspace{10pt} In this section, the implementations of the the software components and the experiments involved in the dissertation are discussed. The design presented in the previous section is revisited. The first subsection summarizes the problems occurred while comparing sensors' energy profiles. It describes the issues related to Android operating system, differences between mobile devices, failed samples in the experiment and Android API. The second subsection presents the implementation details of the energy efficient sensing library, Sensy. [XXX keep going here on Sensy + rewrite next sentence]. The implementation process results in new knowledge on energy-accuracy of phone sensing, which is summarized in the last subsection.

\subsection{Sensors energy measurements}
intro:\\
	how did i end up doing it/problems\\
	generally: available phones + android versions, how old they were, specifications(sensors)\\
		table!\\

\subsubsection{Android operating system}
problem: slow battery depletion\\
	solution: screen on for all apps\\
		increase battery consumption\\
	result: comparison\\

problem: Wireless\\
	switching off WiFi on Android phones\\
		Android switches wireless on from time to time -> special option for those \\
		
	active/passive sampling\\
		why Google doesn't do active scanning?!
			advanatages: faster
			disadvanatages: 
				-energy:
					"radio modem transmission typically requires about 10 times as much power as reception"
				-AP will only respond if i probe direct 
				-introduce additional  traffic
				-privacy:
					Presence analytics\\

	caching Wireless results\\
		-move around check whether it changes
			-are results the same?
		checked with Kismac

\subsubsection{Differences between mobile phones}
problem: different percentage for different phones\\
	end up checking different ones for different phones\\
		trace what I checked for each\\
		HTC Flyer\\
			charging battery to 100\% took forever\\
			then, battery depletion from 100\% to 99\% takes forever\\
			very very fast depletion from 99\% to 95\%\\
		HTC Desire\\
			choose 89->88, as it is old phone and charging was not triggered till if battery level more than 91\%\\
		
problem: hardware differences between phones\\
	camera:\\
		not enough dynamic memory on HTC desire -> but standardize codecs/size to fit all\\
		audio saving -> memory issues\\
			codex issues then\\
			XXX reference appendics camera
	microphone:\\
		(standarized as much as possible)
		XXX reference appendixs microphone
			
\subsubsection{Failed samples}
problem: failed samples\\
	table with failed samples\\
	Google Nexus 7 nice:\\
		results are stable, but others not really\\
			-> so up to 5 successful samples for other phones\\
	reasons why invalid\\
	
	also, battery seems to be getting less stable
	
	XXX REF to Google Nexus 7
	

	XXX REF to HTC FLYER

	XXX REF to HTC DESIRE

Some reference to Figure XXX HOW?

\plot{htc_desire_failed_samples}

	Trepn Profiler\\
	
	
	
	Calibration of results mention here!\\

\subsubsection{Android API}
smaller issues(API and energy efficiency?):\\
	Bluetooth Low Energy\\
		new in Android 18\\
		shaky(no callback when finished):
			-when devices visible ->prints a lot of logs) -> higher energy consumption\\
			-no devices available is good
		
	Camera needs to have a preview\\
		so uses more energy\\
   
   switching off WiFi in Android:\\
   		Google Location Service\\
   
\subsubsection{Conclusions}   
conclusion: on the whole method\\
	accurate\\
	instability of battery\\
		many invalid samples, bursty errors\\
	not universal solution\\
		different percentages work across devices\\
	all of theses makes a method impractical, as requires many samples to get accurate result
		-can't be used as online measurement tool\\
