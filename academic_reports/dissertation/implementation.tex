\subsection{Sensors energy measurements}
intro:\\
	how did i end up doing it/problems\\
	generally: available phones + android versions, how old they were, specifications(sensors)\\
		table!\\
\\
problem: slow battery depletion\\
	solution: screen on for all apps\\
		increase battery consumption\\
	result: comparison\\
problem: Wireless\\
	active/passive sampling\\
problem: differences between phones\\
	audio saving -> memory issues\\
		codex issues then\\
problem: different percentage for different phones\\
	end up checking different ones for different phones\\
		trace what I checked for each\\
problem: failed samples\\
	table with failed samples\\
	reasons why invalid\\
\\
conclusion:\\
	instability of battery, not universal solution\\
		->so no practical, can't be as online measurement tool\\
