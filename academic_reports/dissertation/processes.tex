\section{Software engineering processes}
\label{s:processes}
Programmer: Me\\	
Customer: Tristan\\
Supervisor: Tristan\\

Requirements and Objectives:\\
	-established at the beginning\\
		-so we now what we want to achieve\\
	-requirements were used as milestones\\
		-whether we are on right path\\

Agile approach\\
	-one sentence: implementing, testing, documenting + continuous feedback + aims for the next week
	-reason: research project\\
		-difficult to estimate time needed for different parts\\
			-some of things we were aiming at were never done before\\
			-some of them we didn't know whether it was possible\\
		-the subject is complex, so if we use any other methodology, there would be a risk of not delivering the product on time\\
			
	-on weekly basis:\\
		implementation, testing, documenting\\
		followed by a meeting:\\
			progress document:\\
				documentation of software/testing was done\\
			continuous feedback was given\\
			aims for the next week\\
			
paragraph on other things we did:\\
	-Git\\
		supervisor looking over my code\\
	-Github - opensource\\
		higher quality of work\\
	-citeUlike?\\
	-Eclipse, ADT, no emulators?\\
