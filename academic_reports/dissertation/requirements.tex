\section{Requirements specification}
\label{s:requirements}
The project and the library should satisfy the following set of requirements:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
 \item Primary requirements
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item All software components of the project will work on the Android mobile operating 
system.
    \item Energy efficiency and accuracy of the library should be tested against a baseline 
implementation.
    \item The project should empirically determine energy costs of different sensors.
    \item The library will be integrated with Tristan's experience sampling method~ (ESM) mobile application.
    \item As part of the project, a study with real users should be conducted.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Secondary requirements
  \begin{itemize}
	\item The library will calculate energy costs of different sensors in real time.
  	\item Software components should work on a variety of Android devices.
    \item The energy saving algorithm should be adaptive according to current battery life.
    \item The library intends to manage mobile applications' contention for sensor usage.  
  \end{itemize}
  \item Tertiary requirements
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item The energy saving algorithm should improve its performance by learning from user behaviour. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
