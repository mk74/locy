\section{Requirements specification}
\label{s:requirements}
This section specifies the properties the software solution must satisfy to fulfill the objectives of the project. Analogically to the objectives, the requirements are characterizes by their priority: primary\ (priority 1), secondary\ (2) and tertiary requirements\ (3). Furthermore, the requirements are separated into two sections.
