\section{Objectives}
\label{s:objectives}
\hspace{10pt} This project aims to investigate the energy efficiency of phone sensing. It sets out to review the current state of the art and identify possible enhancements. I intend to establish energy efficiency levels of different sensors in the experiments. The results of those experiments are planned to be leveraged for the design of an energy-efficient sensing library. This library should be implemented and evaluated in real-life scenarios. More specifically, the project has the following objectives: 

\begin{enumerate}
 \item \textbf{Primary objectives}
  \begin{enumerate}
  	\item \label{o:survey:review}To review the current state of the art in sensing, energy measurement methods and energy-efficient sensing.
  	\item \label{o:measurements:primary}To determine the energy efficiency of different sensors.
  	\item \label{o:library:build}To build an energy-efficient sensing library.
  	\item \label{o:library:eval}To evaluate the energy-efficient sensing library.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Secondary objectives}
  \begin{enumerate}
  	\item \label{o:survey:enhancements}To identify possible enhancements in energy measurement methods and energy-efficient sensing.
    \item \label{o:measurements:online}To investigate the possibility of online energy measurement.
    \item \label{o:measurements:devices}To compare the energy measurements across different devices.
    \item \label{o:library:devices}To evaluate the energy-efficient sensing library across different devices.
    \item \label{o:library:battery}To develop an energy-efficient strategy adaptive to a device's battery life.
    \item \label{o:library:apps}To optimize energy efficiency in the case of applications contending for sensor usage.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Tertiary objectives}
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item \label{o:library:original}To develop a new technique for energy-efficient sensing.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
