\section{Objectives}
\label{s:objectives}
\hspace{10pt} This project aims to investigate the energy-accuracy tradeoff in phone sensing. It tries to critically review the current state of the art methods for energy-efficient sensing and identify possible enhancements. As part of the project, a smart sensing library for Android smartphones will be built. The library should embody the ideas presented in this dissertation. The project has a following set of objectives:
