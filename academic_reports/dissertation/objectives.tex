\section{Objectives}
\label{s:objectives}
This project aims to investigate the energy-accuracy tradeoff in phone sensing. It tries to critically review the current state of the art methods for energy-efficient sensing and identify possible enhancements. The outcome of this research is a smart sensing library for Android smartphones, Sensy, which embodies the ideas presented in this dissertation.
